# Privacy Policy for NewsAG

Effective date: 2025-12-14

This Privacy Policy describes how GlitchedNeon ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the NewsAG mobile application ("App"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information we collect
- Personal information you provide:
  - The App does not require you to sign in and does not collect personal information from you (such as name or email) through the App. You may optionally contact us via email; providing your email in that context is voluntary.
- Automatically collected information:
  - Device information (model, OS version).
  - Usage data and analytics (how you use the App, screens visited) collected by the advertising SDK described below.
  - Advertising identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID on Android, IDFA on iOS).
  - Crash reports and performance data collected by SDKs only if present (see section 4).
- Location data:
  - The App does not collect precise location data. Approximate location (city/region) may be inferred by ad providers to serve relevant ads.

2. How we use information
We use the information to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve the App.
- Serve and personalize ads.
- Monitor and analyze usage and trends.
- Troubleshoot issues and debug crashes (only if such SDKs are included).
- Communicate with you if you contact us.

3. Ads and third-party advertising providers
The App displays ads. The only third-party advertising SDK used by NewsAG is:
- Google AdMob

Google AdMob may collect information such as advertising identifiers, device and usage data, and general location to serve personalized ads. If you want to opt out of personalized advertising, use your device-level ad settings (Android: Ads settings; iOS: Limit Ad Tracking / Ad Personalization settings).

4. Third-party SDKs and services
The App includes the Google AdMob SDK for advertising. No other analytics or crash-reporting SDKs are included unless you are otherwise notified. (Note: Android Studio is the development IDE and is not a data collection SDK.)

5. Sharing of information
We may share data with:
- Service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., ad networks).
- Advertising partners to display and target ads.
- Law enforcement or government authorities when required by law.

We will not sell your personal information for money.

6. Data retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described. Usage/analytics data may be retained in aggregated or anonymized form by third parties (for example, ad networks).

7. Security
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. Your rights and choices
- Access and update: If you provided personal data to us by contacting support, you may request access or correction by emailing pizzownzore@gmail.com.
- Opt-out of marketing: Follow unsubscribe instructions in any marketing emails you receive or contact us.
- Advertising opt-out: Use device-level ad settings to limit personalization.
- If GDPR/CCPA apply to you, you may have additional rights (access, deletion, portability). Contact us at pizzownzore@gmail.com.

9. Children’s privacy
The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will delete it.

10. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy. We will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the revised policy.
